A modern crypto donation link generator with a sleek interface and support for multiple wallets.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/donate-me.git
   cd donate-me
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project with your Supabase credentials:

   ```bash
   REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
   REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
   ```

4. Set up your Supabase project:

   - Create a new project on [Supabase](https://supabase.com)
   - Create a table called `custom_links` with the following schema:
     - `id`: uuid (primary key)
     - `slug`: text (unique)
     - `wallets`: jsonb
     - `created_at`: timestamp with timezone

5. Configure CORS in your Supabase project:

   - Go to your Supabase project settings
   - Navigate to API settings
   - Add your application URL to the "Additional allowed origins" section (e.g., http://localhost:3000)

6. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### CORS Errors

If you encounter CORS errors when trying to connect to Supabase, make sure:
